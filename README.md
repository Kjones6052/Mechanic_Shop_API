# **Hello World!**

The files in this repository are designed to create and manage a database for a mechanic shop.


Overview:

These files are developed and designed to create a SQL database for a mechanic shop. I built schemas, models, and endpoint routes using Python, 
and all routes can be tested with the Postman collection located in the "assets" folder, which also contains the ERDs for this project. The routes included give a user the ability to add, update, get all, and delete Customers and Mechanics, as well as add and get all Service Tickets.


I hope you enjoy,

# *Thank you*
